This idea was going to make me .

There was a small complication with my vision - I didnâ€™t know how to build a web application. But thankfully, I could build a static site with HTML and CSS so it couldnâ€™t be that hard, right?

I was wrong, I spent 3 days attempting to learn how a database worked and how to connect the frontend to the backend. Those 3 days were tough and the end of my dream. I was defeated.



What is this guide and how will it help me?
The web application development landscape is capricious in nature and often seen as a dark art to many â€˜non-codersâ€™. The lexicon surrounding the â€˜dark artâ€™ makes it less approachable, and in many ways deterring to hopefuls. I promise you, this guide is not like that.

Within this guide, I hope to shine a light on web application development and provide the reader, you, with a level of understanding which should equip you with the skills and dialogue to stand comfortably amongst developers, and develop your own web application.

This guide is designed for developers (beginner), entrepreneurs, technical product managers, students, engineers, technical marketers.

Youâ€™ll learn what web application development is, how it works, and what you must do to build a web app.

Web application development process

There are many different processes involved with building a web application. Below, I have summarised the different steps involved with the web application development process.

If you are keen to learn how to build a web application in more detail, I would advise you to check out this incredibly informative post - How to build a web app.


1. Define the problem you are solving
Defining the problem is critical. It is your North Star and provides direction. Your solution is born from your problem.

2. Plan the workflow of your web application
Once you know your solution, map out the workflow of how it will work. What needs to happen within your web application for it to solve the problem?

3. Wireframe/prototype your web application
Transform your workflow into a wireframe. Your wireframe is simply a tool for communicating your solution to your target user.

4. Receive Validation
Present your wireframe to potential users of your new web application. Record feedback and iterate on the design until you, and your potential users are happy.

5. Choose your firepower
You will use different tools/platforms/frameworks to build your web application. Itâ€™s important to choose a tool that fits the job (in this case your web application) and not to go with what is popular. Example - for a simple to-do app, Django combined with React might be overkill.

6. Build your web application
Database

Determine what data you need to store in your database and also your data types. Then build your database.

Frontend

You will likely build your frontend and backend at the same time. Your frontend will loosely mirror your wireframe/prototype you validated earlier. The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JS - like one of our frontend frameworks below.

Backend

Building your backend is one of the toughest parts of the web application development process. The primary functions of the backend is to provide HTTP endpoints for your frontend (remember CRUD!), authenticate users, authorization, and to serve the frontend.

7. Test your web application
Testing your web application is an ongoing process and usually happens during and after the building phase. You can automate testing or do it manually. During the testing phase you should try to cover functionality, usability, compatibility, security and performance testing.

8. Host and deploy your web application
Hosting involves running your web application on a server. You will need to buy a domain and choose a cloud hosting provider. To get your web application from your local machine to your cloud provider and deploy it, you will need to use a CI tool.

          <li><p>Backend frameworks
1. Rails written in Ruby
Rails describes itself as â€˜a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) patternâ€™. Rails is a great framework for metaprogramming (where a computer program can treat other programs as their data) and database orientated web programming. In my opinion, Rails is the perfect framework for small projects.

2. Django written in Python
Django describes itself as a â€˜high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic designâ€™. In my opinion, I would advise anyone who is working scientific programming or data manipulation to choose Django.

3. Laravel written in PHP
Laravel describe itself as â€˜a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel is written in PHP - a programming language. Laravel follows the model-view-controller architectural patternâ€™. Laravel has a lot of tools making it accessible and simple to use. It is well suited for multiple types of applications.

Frontend frameworks/libraries
The following frontend frameworks are all written in JavaScript.

1. React
React simply describes itself as â€˜a javascript library for building user interfaceâ€™. This is a very simple and humble description of React. It is a powerful frontend library created and maintained by Facebook. Of all the frontend frameworks listed, React is the most popular and powerful. It is well suited for large-scale web projects. Choosing it for small to medium sized projects is a little overkill - once again, in my opinion.

2. Vue
Vue describes itself as â€˜the progressive JavaScript frameworkâ€™. Vue is smaller in size and easier to learn than React, and is good for most sizes of projects. Itâ€™s also easy to implement into a project which is helpful.

3. Svelte
Svelte describes itself as â€˜cybernativally enhanced web appsâ€™. Svelte is the new kid on the block and is a compiler rather than a framework. This means no virtual DOM, no frameworks on top of frameworks, and no framework to load at runtime, resulting in incredibly performant web applications. Svelteâ€™s syntax makes the framework the easiest to learn from the frontend frameworks mentioned, and perfect for small to medium sized web applications. It is unproven with large web applications. The community and ecosystem is smaller than React and Vue, but itâ€™s growing. Budibase uses Svelte, and we truly love it.

Web application development platforms

Web application development platforms are a super-fast and easier way to build web applications. They remove many of the complexities experienced with coding, and replaces them with a simple to use user interface. This is a pretty new category and the tools can also be described as low-code platforms.
